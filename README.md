# Secure User Authentication System ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Secure User Authentication System** project! This repository demonstrates the implementation of a robust authentication system using **.NET Core API** for backend development and **Angular 18** for frontend development. The system is designed to prioritize security, scalability, and user-friendliness.

## ðŸ›  Features

### **Backend: Secure API Development in .NET Core**
- **Password Encryption:** Securely encrypt user passwords using **bcrypt**.
- **GUID-Based User IDs:** Utilize **GUID** for creating secure and unique user identifiers.
- **OnModelCreating:** Leverage the `OnModelCreating` method for efficient data insertion.
- **Data Validation:** Implement data annotations to ensure valid user input.

### **Frontend: User Interface with Angular 18**
- **API Integration:** Seamlessly consume APIs for user registration and login.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Use **Auth Guard** to protect routes based on user roles.
- **Dynamic Pages:** Display pages dynamically based on user roles such as Admin or User.

### **Role Management**
- Define and manage roles like Admin and User.
- Implement role-based routing to grant access according to permissions.
- Handle API responses effectively to provide feedback for login and registration processes.
